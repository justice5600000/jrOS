# jrOS
[jrOS](https://github.com/justice5600000/jrOS) is an "operating system" written in c# <br>
-----------------Usage------------------------- <br>
to open apps in jrOS type the name of them app into the main screen. <br>
-----------------Settings------------------------- <br>
The commands you can put into settings are: <br>
color set, sets the text color <br>
reset color, sets the text color to white <br>
theme set, ethier set the theme to light or dark <br>
help, displays all commands <br>
login, shows current login info and how to change it <br>
-----------------username & password------------------------- <br>
I finally remade the login system:
The username and pasword are just set to username and password at default <br> 
To change it go in to "userandpass" folder and edit the .txt files <br>
